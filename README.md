# Project 7: NASA API - Space Explorer App
NASA releases a new "Astronomy Picture of the Day" (APOD) every dayâ€”spotlighting breathtaking images of galaxies, stars, planets, and more.

Your task is to build an interactive web app that fetches and displays these photos using [NASA's API](https://api.nasa.gov/). Users will pick a date range and instantly view stunning photos from across the cosmos, along with titles and descriptions.

You'll get to use your skills to build something that's actually connected to real-world data from one of the most iconic organizations in the world.
